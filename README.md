# Project Name
Server Side Calculator

## Description

This project is a simple calculator that is able take in two inputs, send them over to the server to do the calculations, and then be sent back to append to the DOM. The main problem was figuring out how to translate button clicks to tangible data. I did that by reassigning a global variable whenever an operator button was clicked, and then that variable was added into an object to be sent over.
